# SingtelTest
I. Can you implement the sing() method for the bird? `Done`

    	1. How did you unit test it?    `Done`    
    	2. How did you optimize the code for maintainability? **Maintain separate files instead of maintaining all in one class. `Done`
    	
 II. Now, we have 2 special kinds of birds: the Duck and the Chicken ... Can you implement them to make their own special sound? `Done`

    	1. A duck says: “Quack , quack ”   `Done`
    	2. A duck can swim   `Done`
    	3. A chicken says: “ Cluck, cluck ”    `Done`
    	4. A chicken cannot fly (assumption: its wings are clipped but ignore that )   `Done`
    	
III. Now how would you model a rooster?
 
		1. A rooster says: “ Cock-a-doodle-doo ” `Done`
		2. How is the rooster related to the chicken?  `Done`
		3. Can you think of other ways to model a rooster without using inheritance?  `Done`
		
IV. Can you model a parrot? We are specifically interested in three parrots, one that lived in a house with dogs one in a house with cats , the other lived on a farm next to the rooster.

		1. A parrot living with dogs says: “Woof, woof”  `Done`
		2. A parrot living with cats says: “ Me ow” `Done`
		3. A parrot living near the rooster says: “ Cock-a-doodle-doo ”  `Done`
		4. How do you keep the parrot maintainable? What if we need another parrot lives near a Duck? Or near a phone that rings frequently? `Done`
		
B. Model fish as well as other swimming animals 

I. In addition to the birds, can you model a fish? `Done`

		1. Fishes don’t sing
		2. Fishes don’t walk
		3. Fishes can swim
		
II. Can you specialize the fish as a Shark and as a Clownfish? `Done`

		1. Sharks are large and grey
		2. Clownfish are small and colourful (orange)
		3. Clownfish make jokes
		4. Sharks eat other fish
		
III. Dolphin s are not exactly f ish, yet, they are good swimmers `Done`

		1. Can you model a dolphin that swims without inheriting from a fish class?
		2. How do you avoid duplicating code or introducing unneeded overhead?

C. Model animals that change their behaviour over time 

I. Can you model a butterfly? `Done`

		1. A butterfly can fly
		2. A butterfly does not make a sound

II. Can you optimize your model to account for the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly? `Done`

		1. A caterpillar cannot fly
		2. A caterpillar can walk (crawl) 
		
D. Counting animals `Done`

		1. How many of these animals can fly?
		2. How many of these animals can walk?
		3. How many of these animals can sing?
		4. How many of these animals can swim? 
		
		
BONUS

		1. Can you add a second language (if you kno w a language other than English) Use the rooster as a PoC for demonstrating this. For example, this is how the Rooster sounds differently depending on language. Please add the rooster sound in your native tongue.  `Done`
		2. Can you design a RESTful API for querying these animals?  `Done`
